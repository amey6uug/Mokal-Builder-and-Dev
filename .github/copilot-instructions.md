PROGRESS TRACKING:

2. **Professional Design**- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.

   - Primary Color: Deep Indigo (#0F2B5A)- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.

   - Accent Color: Warm Amber (#F5A623)- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

   - Background: White (#ffffff)

   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)COMMUNICATION RULES:

- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.

3. **Advanced Features**- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").

   - Image slider with auto-rotate (5 seconds)- Do not explain project structure unless asked.

   - Manual navigation (arrows, dots)- Keep explanations concise and focused.

   - Contact form with validation

   - WhatsApp integrationDEVELOPMENT RULES:

   - Footer with vertical separators- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.

   - Smooth transitions and animations- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.

- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.

4. **Technology**- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.

   - Pure HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JavaScript- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in VS Code again.

   - Express.js for server- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

   - Zero build dependencies (only Express.js)

   - Fast loading (<2 seconds)FOLDER CREATION RULES:

- Always use the current directory as the project root.

## File Structure- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.

- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.

```- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

## Documentation Reference

**For detailed information**, refer to:
1. **WEBSITE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick overview
2. **WEBSITE_TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete technical details
3. **README.md** - General project information
4. **COLOR_THEME.md** - Design system details
5. **HOW_CONTACT_FORM_WORKS.md** - Form integration guide

## Deployment Ready

The website is production-ready and can be deployed to:
- Netlify (static hosting)
- Vercel (Edge functions)
- Heroku (Node.js)
- Traditional web hosting (with Node.js)
- AWS, Azure, GCP (with appropriate configuration)

## Customization Notes

To customize the website:
1. Edit HTML content in `public/html/[page].html`
2. Modify colors in CSS :root variables
3. Replace company logo in `public/images/logo.jpg`
4. Update contact information in appropriate pages
5. Connect contact form to email service (Formspree/EmailJS)

## Known Limitations (By Design)

- Contact form is frontend-only (needs backend for email)
- Messages not persisted to database (needs backend)
- No authentication system (not required for static site)
- No admin panel (would add complexity)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test website on http://localhost:3001
2. **Short-term**: Update placeholder content with real data
3. **Medium-term**: Connect contact form to email service
4. **Long-term**: Deploy to production hosting

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- [x] Website runs without errors
- [x] All 8 pages accessible and functional
- [x] Professional design applied
- [x] Image slider working with auto-rotate
- [x] Contact form responsive and validated
- [x] Footer properly styled with separators
